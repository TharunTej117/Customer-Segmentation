# Customer-Segmentation
# Project Description 

Customer segmentation is a key technique in marketing analytics that helps businesses understand and categorize their customers into meaningful groups. In this project, we apply K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to identify distinct customer segments based on their annual income and spending behavior.

The dataset used is the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset, which contains demographic information (age, gender) along with financial attributes like income and spending score. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to discover patterns in customer behavior and divide customers into different clusters that represent unique purchasing tendencies.

# Objectives 
1.Group customers with similar purchasing behavior.

2.Identify high-value customers who are likely to spend more.

3.Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

# Methodology
1.Data Preprocessing & Exploration – Cleaning the dataset, visualizing distributions, and selecting relevant features.

2.Elbow Method – Determining the optimal number of clusters (k).

3.K-Means Clustering – Applying the algorithm to segment customers.

4.Visualization – Plotting clusters to interpret customer groups.

# Applications
1.Targeted Marketing.

2.Customer Retention.

3.Business Strategy.
